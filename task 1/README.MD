# Task 1

## Source


### advice.c

Store io_madvice & io_fadvice structures, both have the same exact attributes. Which make them basically the same thing. Except function body treat them as separate. Codes which make use of io_madvice are guarded by compilation macro, which make its relevant functions only active if the build flag is set. But functions that make use of io_fadvice are active all the time. The exact difference between io_madvice & io_fadvice will only known after exploring do_madvise function for io_madvice & vfs_fadvise function for io_fadvice.

### alloc_cache.c

The alloc_cache.c file implements functions to manage a memory allocation cache. The io_alloc_cache_free function is responsible for freeing all cached entries in the allocation cache and releasing the memory used by the cache itself. The io_alloc_cache_init function initializes the allocation cache with a specified maximum number of entries, element size, and optional initialization bytes for clearing memory. If the initialization fails, it returns true. The io_cache_alloc_new function allocates a new object of the specified size from the cache, optionally clearing the memory if the init_clear flag is set. These functions provide efficient memory management by reusing allocated objects and reducing the overhead of frequent memory allocations.

### cancel.c

The cancel.c file implements functions for handling asynchronous and synchronous cancellation of I/O requests in the io_uring subsystem. The io_cancel_req_match function determines if a request matches the cancellation criteria based on flags, file descriptors, opcodes, and user data. The io_async_cancel function handles the cancellation of asynchronous requests, supporting various flags such as IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_ALL and IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_FD. It interacts with other subsystems like polling, timeouts, and futexes to ensure proper cancellation. The io_sync_cancel function provides a synchronous cancellation mechanism, allowing users to specify timeouts and handle fixed or normal file descriptors. The implementation also includes helper functions like io_async_cancel_one and __io_async_cancel to manage cancellation across multiple contexts and work queues. These functions ensure efficient and safe cancellation of I/O operations while maintaining consistency within the io_uring framework.


### epoll.c


The epoll.c file implements functions for managing epoll operations within the io_uring subsystem. It defines two structures: io_epoll, which holds information about an epoll control operation (including the epoll file descriptor, operation type, target file descriptor, and event), and io_epoll_wait, which manages epoll wait operations (including the file, maximum events, and user-space event buffer). The io_epoll_ctl_prep function prepares an epoll control operation by extracting parameters from the submission queue entry (SQE) and validating them. The io_epoll_ctl function executes the epoll control operation using do_epoll_ctl, supporting non-blocking mode if specified. Similarly, the io_epoll_wait_prep function prepares an epoll wait operation, while io_epoll_wait executes it by sending events to the user-space buffer. These functions enable efficient integration of epoll operations into the io_uring framework, providing asynchronous and non-blocking capabilities.



### eventfd.c

The eventfd.c file implements functions for managing eventfd integration within the io_uring subsystem.

The file provides functions such as io_eventfd_register and io_eventfd_unregister to register and unregister eventfd contexts with an io_uring instance. The io_eventfd_signal and io_eventfd_flush_signal functions handle signaling the eventfd when new completion queue entries (CQEs) are posted, ensuring that notifications are only triggered when necessary. The implementation uses RCU (Read-Copy-Update) mechanisms to safely manage eventfd contexts and ensure proper synchronization. Additionally, the file includes helper functions like io_eventfd_grab and __io_eventfd_signal to manage references and trigger eventfd signals efficiently. These functions enable seamless integration of eventfd notifications into the asynchronous io_uring framework.

### fdinfo.c

The file also provides support for showing credentials (io_uring_show_cred) and NAPI-related tracking information (napi_show_fdinfo) when enabled. The implementation ensures safe access to shared data structures using locks and RCU mechanisms, avoiding potential race conditions. This functionality is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring io_uring behavior in real-time.


### filetable.c

The filetable.c file implements functions for managing file descriptor tables within the io_uring subsystem. It provides mechanisms for allocating, freeing, and managing fixed file descriptor slots. The io_alloc_file_tables and io_free_file_tables functions handle the allocation and deallocation of file tables, including bitmap management for tracking available slots. The io_fixed_fd_install and io_fixed_fd_remove functions manage the installation and removal of fixed file descriptors, ensuring proper synchronization and error handling. Additionally, the io_register_file_alloc_range function allows users to specify a range of file descriptor slots for allocation. These functions ensure efficient and safe management of file descriptors, enabling seamless integration with the io_uring framework.

It defines the io_futex structure to represent futex-related requests, including fields for user-space addresses, values, masks, and flags. The file provides preparation functions like io_futex_prep and io_futexv_prep for setting up futex wait and wake operations. Execution functions such as io_futex_wait, io_futexv_wait, and io_futex_wake handle the actual futex operations, ensuring proper synchronization and efficient handling of wakeups. The implementation also includes mechanisms for caching futex data (io_futex_cache_init and io_futex_cache_free) to optimize memory usage. Additionally, cancellation and cleanup functions like io_futex_cancel and io_futexv_complete ensure that futex operations are safely aborted when necessary. These functions integrate seamlessly with the io_uring framework, enabling asynchronous and non-blocking futex operations.
